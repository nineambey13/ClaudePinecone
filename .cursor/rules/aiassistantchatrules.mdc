I'm building an AI assistant chat app with Claude API and Pinecone integration. For this project:

1. Focus on providing architecture guidance and implementation strategies, not writing the entire app
2. Prioritize correctness over clever solutions
3. When suggesting code for API integrations, be explicit about error handling and edge cases
4. For UI components, follow a mobile-first approach since this needs to be responsive
5. Consider data privacy best practices when handling chat storage and retrieval
6. Always provide context for why you're suggesting a particular approach
7. When I ask about specific errors or issues, help me understand the problem before suggesting solutions


This project is for personal use only and needs to handle Claude API integration, Pinecone vector storage, chat history management, and responsive UI similar to Claude's official interfaces.
